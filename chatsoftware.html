      <div class="col-md-9">
          <h5>Jobs to be Done Research</h5>
        <p>In November 2017, a fellow researcher and I conducted 12 Jobs to be Done "Switch"-style interviews. Focusing on people who had been actively involved in the purchasing decision within the past 18 months, we spoke with:</p>
<ul><li>1 unconverted prospect</li>
<li>3 churned customers (one churned for seasonality and plans to return to client)</li>
<li>8 current customers</li></ul>

<p>These interviewees were asked about the circumstances leading up to their decision to switch products, and how their new solution helps them with their work activities in a way the former solution could not.</p> 

<p>Considering the impact of the interviewees comments as a series of "forces" acting upon them, we were able to identify factors that could be manipulated to promote our desired behavior with other customers. </p>

          <img src="./chatsoftware_files/se-fourforces.png" class="img-fluid">
          <img src="./chatsoftware_files/se-forcestable.png" class="img-fluid">

<p>Specifically, the 'push' forces identified could be used by the marketing and sales teams to proactively identify prospects.</p>

<p>After the interviews were complete, we performed a synthesis where we identified different clusters of needs among our respondents. This enabled us to identify two major segments of users with distinct needs and challenges. One of our recommendations was thus to position the product differently for these two markets; focusing on their particular needs, concerns and measures of success.</p>

      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">Admittedly too small to read, this is simply an illustration of how we sliced and diced the data to identify patterns and natural groupings.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Although any good Jobs to be Done practitioner will speak loudly against using job titles for market segmentation üòâ, we did observe that motivations and success measures WERE correlated with the job titles of the people we spoke with. Those who were responsible for marketing, sales and revenue generation had different goals than those who were in customer support roles, who were focused moreso on cost-savings. These served as simple segments to focus on: sales vs support.</p>
