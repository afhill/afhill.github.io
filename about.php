<p>I've always been fascinated by patterns. Natural language, behavioral patterns, system flows. My background spans linguistics, computer science and business (strategy & entrepreneurship), in a continuous attempt to understand, anticipate and optimize the world around me. </p>

<p>I have over a decade's worth of experience in user experience, design, product strategy, intrapreneurship and innovation, in both agency and corporate environments. I've established and led teams and programs, including launching a cross-functional Innovation team at ReadyTalk, which showed tremendous impact within its first year.</p>

           <p>I believe that the biggest risk in software development today isnâ€™t whether something can be built, itâ€™s whether customers value what the product provides, and are willing to pay to use it.</p>

          <p>I believe that knowing why customers do things is more important than knowing what they do. I understand itâ€™s often hard to get to the â€˜whyâ€™, but I'm committed to the effort.</p>

          <p>I believe that thereâ€™s no guarantee a given product will be a market success, but there are proven strategies and activities that will improve the likelihood it will. </p>

          <p>I believe that when you start with an explicit vision and set of beliefs, youâ€™ll never be disappointed with the results. </p>
